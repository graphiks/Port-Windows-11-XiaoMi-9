# Running Windows on the Redmi K20 Pro / Mi 9T Pro

## Optional post-install stuff
> [!NOTE]
> All of these are optional, but enabling USB host mode is recommended otherwise non-powerered USB devices will not work.

### Prerequisites
- [This registry file](https://github.com/graphiks/Port-Windows-11-Raphael/releases/download/raphael-usb/USB-OTG_ON.reg) 
- [This batch script](https://github.com/graphiks/Port-Windows-11-Raphael/releases/download/raphael-usb/OTG.and.Charge.switcher.bat)

### Enabling USB Host mode
> [!NOTE]
> This will also disable charging (not that you would want to charge in Windows anyways)

 - Run the .reg file you just downloaded on your phone, click yes.
 - Run the batch script that you just downloaded on your phone. Select option 1 <br>
(Re-run the batch script and select 2 if you want charging back)

This makes USB work properly. If USB doesn't work, you may have to plug it in before boot.


## Finished!
